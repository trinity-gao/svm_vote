Though I didn’t find them here, it is bc of this group that I force myself to drive all the way out east to go to Deka Lash on E broad, as it is a black owned franchise. I have purchased a matching mask and head wrap from hint of culture. By far my favorite mask. I make it a point to visit a black owned food truck before giving my dollars to a restaurant chain wherever I can during lunch. I mean long story short, I put an emphasis on BLACK this year, and this group is a daily reminder of why I do it. Regardless of the results of this election, I think we already knew that WE GOT US. We never had a candidate that stepped up to make up for how many CENTURIES they held us back, so we gon step and do it ourselves. We need to be boujie, we need to be exclusively BLACK all 2021 until we’re flooding into the neighborhoods they try so hard to keep us out of. Anyways, That was my soapbox speech.

I wanna make this as clear as I can. This is the last time I will ever talk about it. I know it's election day (I hope everyone here voted) and I know the internet is filled with politics and people debating on which candidate is better or worse than the other. I have made the decision that this group will remain politics free from now on. I'm sick and tired of the division that politics cause on people. I love people. I think human interaction is one of the best things in the world and politics do the exact opposite. And my group will not support that. I don't care if you vote for Trump or Biden. Do what you think it's best for this country. But do it consciously, the future of this country depends on it. I respect everyone's opinion and everybody should do the same. We are not here to have a bad time, right? We are here to enjoy and celebrate the city we all love. Whoever wins tonight, I hope it's the right choice for this country. We need a good man leading the United States of America. I just hope everything turns out good in the end. Peace & love ✌🏼",,,,,,,,312,3.97

Please know the facts about Prop 15. It may sound good to jump on board....make large businesses pay more taxes.....but like always, it’s not them who will actually pay the tax. It will destroy the already struggling small businesses in California. There are few if any commercial properties in the Bay Area worth less than $3 million. Many small businesses are able to stay in business because they bought their building 20+ years ago. They cannot afford to pay this tax increase. Other small businesses rent and those leases would be largely triple net which means the property tax increase will be passed on to them immediately. For the few who have a gross lease the property owner would pass the tax when the lease renews. Businesses would then have to pass the tax increase to the consumers. Others would close or move out of state. Prop 15 will especially hurt minority owned businesses. Before we give the government anymore money, there needs to be accountability. Property tax revenues have been increasing for years, more funding for schools but yet it’s never enough.

Get you an LLC (incorporate your name!!) and run it as an S Corp. Remember Jay-Z quote “I’m not a Businessman I’m a Business Maaaaaaaan....” Let that sink in. Build business credit! The loans are bigger and the interest rate is lower. Get a business bank account (in most cases this costs around $500 to start). Some people got two stimulus checks (one from Trump and one from the SBA). Also no fees. Go to Community College first and transfer into a four year college (unless you have scholarships to help mitigate the costs) as a Junior. School is a power move you must be able to secure the bag. Majors in STEM will always be needed, are in high demand and the skills can directly help the black community. Get with your peers from your graduating class and others together at homecoming on one day for two hours to plot and strategize how we can move our communities forward (commerce, politics, education, small businesses, real estate, etc...) If you want to support Black People, support Black Business and Black Institutions of Higher Education. Get life insurance for you (whole life) and your children (term) as soon as they are born (one thing is for sure is we will die..might as well leave your kids or family something extra). The sooner you get it, the cheaper it is. And you can borrow against it to fund certain projects. Also, the ones that pay out dividends are the best! They normally are associated with the market (money market accounts). IUL’s are great! Get the people in your immediate family to save collectively! If 10 people save $500/month, that’s 60k every year. You could buy 3 starter homes every year and in 4 years all ten of you are home owners. Buy on the same block or neighborhood if you can...this way you control the value of the homes (remember Monopoly!). We need to promote financial literacy. Building capital and creating equity to create generational wealth. Having financial freedom is everything! This is not being taught in the school curriculums or our education systems! We must do it ourselves! ***I need 10 people to copy and repost this on their pages and groups.*** copy from Vance Hendricks",,,,,,,,131,2.98

Our leaving today is mixed with happiness, sadness, and even a little regret for the things we should have done and did not get around to doing yet. The happiness is all the laughter we had while we were here, the sadness if for the departed friends whom we will never see again. Though we will never see them, their memories linger on. They will still be with us, even though they maybe gone. As we leave today we must remember the friends we have still, and the new ones we have made. As friends are so important within our daily lives. They share our happiness when our hearts are filled with joy. Their comforting arms are around us when times of sadness appear.

We have two rooms available in our lovely 3 story row home. We're located at the intersection of three of the coolest neighborhoods in DC - Columbia Heights, Mt. Pleasant, and Adams Morgan. It's an easy walk to Meridian Hill Park, Safeway & Harris Teeter, and all the other stores & amenities in this busy neighborhood. The house is very spacious - the first floor is all common areas, including a living room, dining room, kitchen, and lovely back patio. The second floor has 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, and a washing & drying unit. The third floor has 2 more bedrooms! Both available rooms are on the 2nd floor of the house, so will share a bathroom with 2 other people. Everything is fully furnished, except the available rooms, but even those have some leftover furniture in them. Our landlord is wonderful and super responsive to our needs as a house. Unfortunately, no pets allowed. Rent for the two available rooms is $800/month + utilities (electric, gas, water, WiFi) of about $50-100/month. The current housemates are three mid-20s, plant loving ladies who enjoy cooking and getting coffee together on the weekends. We like living in a clean and quiet home, with people who are respectful and COVID-conscious (and willing to buy more plants). It's important to us to find a housemate who we can all get along with and fits into our laid back vibe! If you're interested in living here, please send me an message and we will do a virtual tour of the house.

In my early 20s so absolutely thrilled to jump in and experience everything DC has to offer (with COVID precautions of course). While I’m looking to explore the area, I’m just as happy watching some Netflix or reading a good book. I love to bake/cook as good food is one of the joys in life, but always leave the kitchen cleaner than I found it. Interested in intellectual conversation, but must be blue, LGTBIA+, BLM space.

Later on after my graveyard shift at O’hare waiting for Harris bank to open...we all went to Ronnys for $1.95 steak breakfast. At the Randolph location there was the AM/PM Disco where you could go dancing at damn near any time. At the Van Buren location there was a club downstairs. And finally years later after a play at the Schubert Theatre we went to Ronnys in the Thompson Center.

Despues de que los organizadores se sentaran frente al automóvil de ICE, finalmente lograron que liberaran al custodiado.

I’m looking for someone to takeover my room in a sunny 3 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom apartment located literally across the street from Meridian Hill Park. Rent is $1000/ month and includes all utilities except internet (+$17/ month). Move-in date for late October/ early November 2020 (I have a bit of flexibility). If interested, tell me a bit about yourself and we can set up a virtual tour! ☺️ ----------------------------- **APARTMENT: **This is a 3 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom apartment, located across the street from Meridian Hill Park. The apartment was newly renovated in July 2019, has in-unit washer and dryer and dishwasher, and windows in the common areas span south/ west/ north (see photos below, all taken under natural light). The bedroom is unfurnished, but all common areas are furnished. Unfortunately, no pets. **RENTAL TERMS:** Rent is $1000/ month including all utilities except internet (which is an additional ~$17 per month). The current lease ends at the end of the year, and can be renewed in January 2021. Ideally looking for someone interested in staying more than just a few months. **LOCATION**: The apartment is located literally across the street from Meridian Hill Park - our closest intersection is W and 15th Street. We are 7-10 minutes walking from all major grocery stores (Trader Joes, Harris Teeter, Safeway), 8 minutes from the U Street Metro station, and walking distance to a lot of restaurants and bars. **ROOMMATES**: The two current roommates are both young professionals – one works in the international development sector (M, from Brazil), and the other for the US Government (F, from Seattle). Both are some of the kindest individuals I've ever met, super clean, and wonderful cooks (see Instagram photos). We cook a lot together and do ""fancy dinner"" nights, have board games/ movie nights every so often, and chat about global issues.

(Article via nypost) Puerto Rico’s governor endorsed President Trump’s re-election bid on Tuesday.

In an interview with Telemundo, Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced announced her support for Trump and urged Puerto Ricans in the United States to vote for him on Nov. 3.

“I ask all Puerto Ricans who are listening to go vote,” Vázquez Garced said.

The Republican official was to participate in a campaign event with Trump in central Florida on Friday but it was canceled after the president tested positive for COVID-19, according to Miami Herald reporter Syra Ortiz-Blanes.

Vázquez Garced endorsed Trump despite his opposition to the island’s statehood, something she supports.

Puerto Rico is a US territory but people on the island are ineligible to vote in the presidential election.

In the Telemundo interview, Vázquez Garced was asked about Trump’s infamous visit to the island where he tossed paper towels to Puerto Ricans devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017.",,,84,1.4

We are looking for** **new roommate to complete our **three bedroom row house **in the** NoMa/H Street neighborhood. **It is a multi-level house with a huge kitchen, large living space and small backyard. There’s also an in-unit washer and dryer, and parking is easily accessible on the street. Rent for the available bedroom/shared bathroom is $1025 + utilities. The Neighborhood: The house is on a quiet street that has a mix of recent college graduates and young families. It’s walkable to the NoMa-Gallaudet University Metro (7 min walk) and also to several grocery stores (Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Harris Teeter and Giant), CVS, and lots of restaurants and bars (Union Market, H Street). About Us: We’re two mid-twenties professionals working at environmental nonprofits in DC. During COVID-19 we have enjoyed finding time to get outside and watching new shows/movies. But we also know that COVID-19 means spending more time than usual at home, so we are respectful of each other's time and space as well. We are looking for someone to fill the room for 10 months, through the end of our lease on July 31, 2020.

Wildfires all over California have created a layer of smoke over the San Francisco Bay Area. The smoke filters the light from the sun only allowing the orange and yellow hues through creating an eerie scene throughout the day. Not only was the sky orange, but it was also as dark as dusk even in the middle of the day. 

Shot with Nikon Z7. All set to 5500K for to keep the color consistent.

The property will not be Tax Exempt. Please Join our Cause! Dear Friend of Copernicus, As you might know, the Copernicus Foundation is trying to buy the abandoned firehouse at 4841 N. Lipps from the City of Chicago in a negotiated sale. The Foundation would renovate the property keeping its historic façade and having it be part of our campus. The Copernicus Foundation is willing to pay $300,000 for the property which the city appraised at $208,000. Sadly, the city appears to be accepting an offer from an outside developer, Ambrosia Homes, who will only be paying $1 for the property. There are a number of steps that have to be taken before that sale is final, so we are asking for your support in trying to stop the sale. Please visit our website at www.FightForTheFirehouse.com to express your support of the Copernicus Foundation by signing our petition. The site will also allow you to send an e-mail directly to your Alderman asking him not to vote for the negotiated sale of the firehouse to Ambrosia Homes. Please pass this information along to any of your friends and colleagues and also SHARE IT ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA so we will be able to show Mayor Lightfoot and the Aldermen that the community supports the Copernicus Foundation in its endeavor to develop this property in the best interests of our community.",https://www.fightforthefirehouse.com/,,,Copernicus Foundation's Fight For The Firehouse,"You can support us by signing our petition and asking your colleagues, friends and neighbors to sign the petition also.",,,141,1.09

Reposting as I am still in need of roommates and one of the availability dates has changed from the original post. I am looking to fill the upstairs bedroom and the basement bedroom in a 3 level condo. The basement bedroom will be available November 1st and the upstairs bedroom by November 15th. The lease will last until December 31st with option to renew for next year. Rent is $975 a month plus utilities (we will occasionally have a house cleaner come clean the place, also separate fee). About the place: It is a Capitol Hill area townhouse with a short 10 minute walk to the Hill. The place is a 15min walk to the Wharf, 20 min walk to Nats Stadium, and 5-7min walk from both Waterfront and Federal Center SW metro stations. There is a Safeway, CVS, a farmer’s market, and a few dining places about a 7 min walk away as well. W/D in unit, Free Air conditioning during the summer, LOTS of Natural light. There is also access to the community pool and park. Street parking is available with permit, and there will be 1 parking spot available in the parking lot once my roommate leaves. Guest Parking is also available on the street (with guestpass). The townhouse complex has a security guard. There is beautiful landscaping around the townhouses. About the upstairs room: (see photos). The room will come unfurnished. You will be on the top floor, where there is also a second bedroom currently occupied by me. The bathroom is shared. The room is pretty spacious, you can fit a queen sized bed, a desk, dresser etc. About the basement bedroom: (see photos). The room will also come unfurnished. You will be on the first level of the condo, and will have your own separate bathroom on the same floor. This is the largest bedroom, so it is very spacious and fits a queen sized bed, a desk, a dresser etc. About me: Female, late twenties, just recently relocated to DC for grad school. Guests are fine as long as you give me a heads up in advance. I would like someone who is friendly & keeps the common areas clean. For the upstairs room, I’d prefer another female roommate. Feel free to message me some information about you, and any additional questions you have. Additional photos can be provided upon request.
