She was an American politician, diplomat, and activist. She was the longest-serving First Lady of the United States, having held the post from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office. She also served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952.

President Harry S. Truman later called her the ""First Lady of the World"" in tribute to her human rights achievements.

In 1996 a sculpture of Eleanor was dedicated at 72nd Street & Riverside Dr. in the presence of Hillary Rodham Clinton, First Lady of the United States at the time.

Dev Davis and Helen Chapman

Willow Glen Neighborhood Association sponsored a forum at the Starlight Ballroom in Willow Glen, our moderator was Ken Podgorsek, Chairperson for Santa Clara County United Neighborhoods, a highly respected leader in the City of San Jose, and Santa Clara County.

I would like to repeat Ken's comment at the end of the WGNA Forum, I believe it needs to be said: ""I would like to thank both candidates for the District 6 Council seat, my only regret is I wish we could save both of them to represent us on the City Council, 2017"". Personally, I agree with Ken's opinion.
This is a race for the residents of Willow Glen and all of District 6 to choose whom will represent the neighborhood views and concerns, ""public safety'' being, once again in 2016 being the major issue. An issue that has not been solved at the end of 2014 election.

Yes, there are other issues. We must realize that this is the District 6 area as a whole, its residents, and our local business districts  issues.  Once elected one of them will be fighting for our share of the City of San Jose's budget,""not the whole Silicon Valley, or special interests groups interests. 
Thank you.",,,0,-110

How can that be?

Well, it's something like this. You have eight dollars and some change in your pocket, so you decide to get some lunch. You by a really yummy sandwich, but before you get a chance to eat, the neighborhood bully comes along and takes your lunch. Left with nothing more than some change in your pocket, you throw your last four quarters in the vending machine and buy a small bag of chips.

So, there you have it. You spent more money for lunch, nine dollars instead of eight dollars, but you certainly received a lot less than you started off with when the bully showed up.

It's the same thing for charter schools. With limited resources, school committees are squeezed between underfunded state appropriations and strict state limits on municipal taxation. A charter school is imposed by the state, and they take a very generous chunk out of your town's Chapter 70 aid. Maybe you can scrape up a couple of more bucks, some user fees, maybe an override, but you end up with much less than you started with for a higher cost.

Don't let a bunch of New York hedge fund guys eat your lunch. Vote NO on Question 2.",,,3,-24

The landmarked 20-story French Renaissance château-style building was designed by noted architect Henry J. Hardenbergh.

Many famous performers and guests have stayed at The Plaza. It has also been the meeting place for important political meetings. In 1993 Donald Trump celebrated his wedding to Marla Maples in front of 1,500 guests.

The building continues to serve as luxury hotel. In recent times some of the space was turned into condominium apartments. When the it opened, a room was only $2.50 per night, the equivalent of $63 today. The same room costs over 15 times as much today.

How in any reality can they vote to destroy the 21, after they voted to preserve it as a state landmark?",https://www.facebook.com/PACSJ/photos/a.391710240854413/1510595518965874/?type=3,,,Preservation Action Council of San Jose,"CENTURY 21 ALERT!!

Interested in having Century 21 restored and reused? The next step in the process is at Tuesday night's City Council meeting. The Council will discuss the proposed Santana West project sometime after the 7 PM meeting start time. Although final decisions won’t be made on the project at Tuesday’s meeting, the way things are going Tuesday’s decision will pretty much set the direction for what is going to happen in the future.

The actual decisions before the Council on Tuesday will be to certify the Santana West EIR and adopt a statement of overriding considerations and mitigation monitoring and reporting program; decisions related to the I-280/Winchester Boulevard Transportation Development Policy; approve a rezoning for the site to allow up to approximately one million square feet of office and commercial/retail, including mini-storage, outdoor theater, and television/radio station uses on an approximately 12.99 gross acre site.

The Mayor and some Council members have issued a memo (link below) approving the staff recommendations with some
modifications. Note Recommendation #9 which asks for ""an analysis of the potential adaptive re-use of the Century 21 landmark
for a community-enhancing amenity beyond mere mini-storage use, such as a public plaza, open-air amphitheater, park or other
recreational use.”

It would appear the Mayor and some Council members are willing to at least consider a proposal that would destroy the historic integrity and status of the landmark Century 21 building. 

This meeting would be the time to voice your concerns if you think Century 21 should be restored and reused and not stripped away and turned into a shell. If you believe any proposal that basically strips the building apart and destroys its historic integrity should not receive any further consideration you should speak out Tuesday night.

Century 21 is a difficult building to reuse for something other than a theater. The movie business has changed since Century 21 was ""the"" place to see a movie in San Jose and the South Bay. If you don't believe that it's time has come and gone then this would be the time to share your ideas for viable proposals for reusing a restored Century 21, and not reducing it to a mere shell of the building. 

If the Mayor's recommendation moves forward there is a good chance that Century 21 may not survive.

In addition to speaking or commenting in writing at the City Council meeting, now would also be a good time to contact your Councilmember if you live in San Jose.

Below you will find links to the Mayor's memo and also the Supplemental Staff Report from the Planning Department.

For those who have followed the saga of this proposal, you will remember that the Impact Advisory Group for the hotel's construction made it clear that there should be no high signage added to that area. At the time of the IAG's gatherings, there was agreement on that point between the residents and the development company. IMHO, it would signal diminution of the importance of IAGs in the community review process if those meetings were for naught. This would be the appropriate time for the city to implement a moratorium on any additional billboards within the city confines - starting with the McClellan Highway corridor. Due to my attending a wake and, then, attending to my son after an injury, I was unable to be present at the last two OHNC meetings, which means that I cannot vote at the upcoming meeting.

This election season has often shined a light on darkness. But what local hiker Mana Shahgoli experienced recently was pure light.

The mayor, city council, and your police comm all prior to this incident, informed the media, and union memberships that such firepower was not needed in Boston.

Gauge the appetite for your proposal. If you sense that you do not have enough support, ask for a delay in a vote by the group. You may need to ask for several delays depending upon how long (probably months) it will take to gather enough people to attend the requisite number of meetings before they can cast votes. Then, you need to ask your ""advocate"" to find someone to speak favorably on your offering of cash to fix problems on private property that have been ignored by benign neglect.
